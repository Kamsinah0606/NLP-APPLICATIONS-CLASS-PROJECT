I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known.

This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while.",1

My friend and I were only in town for a few days, and this is something we wanted to experience.

While there we figured that we would order something, so we both got a dessert item, my friend got a McFlurry, and I got a Hard Ice Cream in a Waffle Cone.

We ordered from the self serve kiosk, for some reason the one we were at was not accepting payment, not sure if the others were broken too? So I went to the one counter that had an Employee and paid there, since it was Ice Cream I was told that it would be available at the Ice Cream counter, which made sense, since that's where the Hard Ice Cream was.

My friend and I waited quite awhile for a Staff Member to notice us standing there, I say notice us, since some came close, but never looked over at us... When one finally did I flagged her down, she told us that she ""has not be told to come here"" then walked away!?!

So, I went to the main counter, as I approached my number was being called from the main counter, so I guess the Ice Cream counter was not the pick up location? Ahh, the McFlurry came from the main counter, but the Hard Ice Cream was coming from the Ice Cream counter... sure, that makes sense I suppose?

I head back over to the Ice Cream Counter, and guess who reluctantly appears? The young Female Employee who was now told to come over to serve me... she DID NOT look impressed to be there! After fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the Hard Ice Cream for several minutes, she finally got them open, I had to point out the Rocky Road Ice Cream, one small scoop was placed on the Waffle Cone, and I was sent on my way... I'm not sure what it was supposed to look like, since on the Kiosk, it only shows an empty Waffle Cone with no option of its contents.

It was an interesting place, but based on this one visit, I would likely not return unless it was much less busy.",3 stars,3,Neutral,Positive,neutral,i realize this is a really big and really popular location because it is unique my friend and i were only in town for a few days and this is something we wanted to experience while there we figured that we would order something so we both got a dessert item my friend got a mcflurry and i got a hard ice cream in a waffle cone we ordered from the self serve kiosk for some reason the one we were at was not accepting payment not sure if the others were broken too so i went to the one counter that had an employee and paid there since it was ice cream i was told that it would be available at the ice cream counter which made sense since thats where the hard ice cream was my friend and i waited quite awhile for a staff member to notice us standing there i say notice us since some came close but never looked over at us when one finally did i flagged her down she told us that she has not be told to come here then walked away so i went to the main counter as i approached my number was being called from the main counter so i guess the ice cream counter was not the pick up location ahh the mcflurry came from the main counter but the hard ice cream was coming from the ice cream counter sure that makes sense i suppose i head back over to the ice cream counter and guess who reluctantly appears the young female employee who was now told to come over to serve me she did not look impressed to be there after fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the hard ice cream for several minutes she finally got them open i had to point out the rocky road ice cream one small scoop was placed on the waffle cone and i was sent on my way im not sure what it was supposed to look like since on the kiosk it only shows an empty waffle cone with no option of its contents it was an interesting place but based on this one visit i would likely not return unless it was much less busy,i realiz thi is a realli big and realli popular locat becaus it is uniqu my friend and i were onli in town for a few day and thi is someth we want to experi while there we figur that we would order someth so we both got a dessert item my friend got a mcflurri and i got a hard ice cream in a waffl cone we order from the self serv kiosk for some reason the one we were at wa not accept payment not sure if the other were broken too so i went to the one counter that had an employe and paid there sinc it wa ice cream i wa told that it would be avail at the ice cream counter which made sens sinc that where the hard ice cream wa my friend and i wait quit awhil for a staff member to notic us stand there i say notic us sinc some came close but never look over at us when one final did i flag her down she told us that she ha not be told to come here then walk away so i went to the main counter as i approach my number wa be call from the main counter so i guess the ice cream counter wa not the pick up locat ahh the mcflurri came from the main counter but the hard ice cream wa come from the ice cream counter sure that make sens i suppos i head back over to the ice cream counter and guess who reluctantli appear the young femal employe who wa now told to come over to serv me she did not look impress to be there after fight with the slide glass door that cover the hard ice cream for sever minut she final got them open i had to point out the rocki road ice cream one small scoop wa place on the waffl cone and i wa sent on my way im not sure what it wa suppos to look like sinc on the kiosk it onli show an empti waffl cone with no option of it content it wa an interest place but base on thi one visit i would like not return unless it wa much less busi
